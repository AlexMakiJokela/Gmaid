# Gmaid
Keeps your inbox from being a shitshow. Is free.

More specifically, automatically archive any emails more than two days old that haven't been starred. 

This means - if emails are important/relevant, star them, if not, trust that they'll be archived in a couple days and you don't have to go through them later to manually (ew) manage your inbox. If you want to skim your important stuff, just scroll down to the bottom of your inbox and deal with or unstar anything there and Gmaid will take care of the rest.

Installation:

1) Log into gmail

2) Go to script.google.com

3) Look at the code in gmaid.js to make sure you grok what it does. It's fifteen lines. Don't blindly trust strangers on the internet.

4) Paste the code from gmaid.js into the box. Modify whatever you want to modify.

5) Click "Resources-->Current project's triggers" and set it to run daily at whatever time. 

I don't plan to add any features to this or do any more work on it. However, if you appreciate the new inbox sanity or blood, sweat, and tears that went into writing this ambitious software package, I won't turn down paypal/venmo/squarecash, firstname(starts with A) dot lastname (starts with M and is sort of long) at gmail. 

Based on my memory, dollars will go towards vice, materials for ambitious technical art projects (example: Dr. Brainlove), or rent.
